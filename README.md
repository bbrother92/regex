[docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/index.html)
### Notes:

### Matcher methods  
`matches()` attempts to match the entire region against the pattern  
`lookingAt()` same as matches method but it does not require that the entire region be matched  
`find()` attempts to find the next subsequence of the input sequence
